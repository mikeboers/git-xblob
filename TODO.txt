- Config files: .gitxblobconfig

  This is roughly INI style:

    [xblob]
    geturl = ...
    puturl = ...
    encrypted = true

  Walk up from the current directory merging until you are beside .git.

  Use http://docs.python.org/2/library/configparser.html: can likely
  use the builtin methods to do all the reading.

- Link files: .gitxblobx
  This is roughtly the git tree format:
      100644 xblob <hash> <path>

- Add to .gitignore:

  # git-xblob linked files
  /path/to/a
  /path/to/b

  - Search for r'# git-xblob[^\n]*\n([^\n]+\n)', and replace it with the
    new list. Add it to the end if it cannot be found.

- Several upload/download classes:
  - http(s)
  - ssh
  - s3
  - dropbox (maybe not possible)
  - files

  - They look in `git config` for their secrets if not provided. This allows
    `git xblob init` to ask for the secrets and save them there.


- Encryption

  - Files on the server are encrypted.
  - Files in .git/xblob/objects are encrypted.
  - .gitxblobs is encrypted.

  - This isn't really nessesary if the files are private, and we don't
    care about potential leaks via hash of file contents or file names.
