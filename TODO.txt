- What to name it?
    git assets
    git external
    git ext
    git xblob (external blob) ***
    git rblob (remote blob)

- Should the config and links be in the same file, or different ones?
  - .gitxblobs and .gitxblobconfig ??
  - if they are seperate, then we can use the git tree format:
      100644 xblob <hash> <path>

- In the future support multiple URLs for different parts of the project,
  but don't bother for right now.

- File format for both configuration and file hashes.

  - HTML like:

    Content-Type: application/git-xblob
    Get-URL: http://assets.mikeboers.com/project_name
    Put-URL: ssh:mikeboers.com:/srv/mikeboers.com/assets/static
    Hash-Alg: sha1

    <hash> path/to/file
    <hash> path/to/file

  - INI like

    [xblobconfig]
    geturl = http://example.com
    puturl = ssh:example.com/xblob

    [xbloblinks]
    <hash> = path/to/file
    <hash> = path/to/file

  - INI and git-tree

    geturl = http://example.com
    100644 <hash> path/to/file

- Add to .gitignore:

  # git-xblob
  /path/to/a
  /path/to/b

  - Search for r'# git-xblob\n([^\n]+\n)', and replace it with the
    new list. Add it to the end if it cannot be found.
    
- Hierarchical configuration: walk up from the current directory until
  you hit a folder with .git.

- Several upload/download classes:
  - http(s)
  - ssh
  - s3
  - dropbox (maybe not possible)
  - files

  - They look in `git config` for their secrets if not provided. This allows
    `git xblob init` to ask for the secrets and save them there.

- .gitassetconfig for the values to throw into .git/config when it is
  initialized
    
    - link it into the [include] section in .git/config
        git config --add include.path ../myconfig

    - example with public downloads

        [assets]
        geturl = ssh:mikeboers.com:srv/mikeboers.com/assets/project_name
        puturl = http://assets.mikeboers.com/project_name

    - example with private downloads

        puturl = ssh:mikeboers.com:project_name


- Encryption!

  - Files on the server are encrypted.
  - Files in .git/assets may be encrypted.
  - Contents of .gitassets may be encrypted.
  - Either need to encrypt .gitassets, or use hashes of encrypted files.

  - This isn't really nessesary if the files are private, and we don't
    care about potential leaks via hash of file contents or file names.
