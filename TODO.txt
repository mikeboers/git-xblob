- don't add the same path multiple times to .gitattributes

- deal with spaces in .gitattributes; the only thing I have found
  is to put a question mark in there (which matches any character, so
  warn the user about it).

- `git xblob add --glob` allows patterns instead of names

- `git xblob init --get <url> --put <url>`: set the urls, and write them
  to .gitxblobconfig.

- perhaps include the config via `git config --add include.file <include>`.
  Remember that the path to the include is relative to the master config.

- Stub files should be allowed to contain any content. On the clean pass, they
  should return the same content that is already in the repo as long as the hash
  is the same. `git xblob regen` could forcibly regenerate it all.

  The stub could look like:

    git-xblob f572d396fae9206628714fb2ce00f72e94f2258f

    This is a stub for a file stored outside of git, created by git-xblob
    (see: http://github.com/mikeboers/git-xblob).

    You may be able to manually download the file from:

    http://example.com/path/to/store/f5/72d396fae9206628714fb2ce00f72e94f2258f

  - `git show HEAD:"hello.txt"` shows the current version of the file.
