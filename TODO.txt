- swap all `git` calls to `call`

- `xblob.manual` mode will not autodownload anything, but require a
  `git xblob get [-r] <pattern>`
    - check each to make sure it matches the attributes
    - then check to make sure they have the right header

- Stub files should be allowed to contain any content. On the clean pass, they
  should return the same content that is already in the repo as long as the hash
  is the same. `git xblob regen` could forcibly regenerate it all.

  The stub could look like:

    git-xblob f572d396fae9206628714fb2ce00f72e94f2258f

    This is a stub for a file stored outside of git, created by git-xblob
    (see: http://github.com/mikeboers/git-xblob).

    You may be able to manually download the file from:

    http://example.com/path/to/store/f5/72d396fae9206628714fb2ce00f72e94f2258f

  - `git show HEAD:"hello.txt"` shows the current version of the file.
