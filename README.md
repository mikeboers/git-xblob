git-xblob
=========

This tool allows for linking files into a `git` repository, but does not actually store the files in that repository.

In this manner, you can keep large or private files out of a public repository.


Installation
=======

~~~
git clone https://github.com/mikeboers/git-xblob
cd git-xblob
pip install .
~~~
